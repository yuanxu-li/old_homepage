<h1>Interests</h1>
<p>I have been playing guitar since high school, still an amateur though. The very motivation that triggers me to learn to play guitar is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_l_isDoZfY">Surface</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheer_Chen">Cheer Chen</a>. I do not play guitar as often as I used to, and as a result, I do not expect too much progress in future. But the thing that matters is, it always accompanies me as a friend, whenever I need. Singing and writing songs are my favorite way of expressing myself.</p>
<p>I read a lot, mostly novels. My favorite writer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami">Haruki Murakami</a>, a Japanese novelist. Though he is not a Nobel laureate yet, many people have been predicting that he would be the next Nobel prize winner in literature, for several years.</p>
